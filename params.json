{"name":"GenbankSearch","tagline":"Searches any GenBank database. Returns all results and results since the last time the program ran (all new submissions) in orderly files.","body":"### What is GenBank?\r\nThe NCBI GenBank Database is a collection of millions of DNA/RNA sequences in order to be shared by the scientific community. Within GenBank itself, smaller databases, each containing separate collections of data, have specific criteria for information in the database. This specificity allows for great informational gain, but, because of the volume of GenBank, can sometimes be overlooked. Especially with many searches, it is often difficult to determine if you have used the information before or if it has recently been added to the database. Our program, GenBankSearch.py, allows the user to search any of GenBank's databases and produces a FASTA file of all the hits of your GenBank search and a FASTA file of all of the new submissions to GenBank.  \r\n\r\n### Notes\r\nNew submissions are defined as submissions since your last search of GenBank using this program. Therefore, in order to get new submissions in a file, you must run this program a second time after a period of time.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nThis program was created at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, Apprill Lab by Evan Denmark (@edenmark) and Matthew Neave (@neavemj) in 2014.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
